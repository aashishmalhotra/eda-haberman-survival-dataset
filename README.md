# Exploratory Data Analysis: Haberman's Cancer Survival Data Set
In this project, I did an in-depth analysis and visualization on the FIFA18 dataset. The dataset is collected at this GitHub Repo. The goal is to predict the best possible international squad lineups for these 10 teams: France, Germany, Spain, England, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Portugal, Uruguay, and Croatia at the 2018 World Cup this summer in Russia.

The complete notebook can be accessed <link>here</link>.

I also wrote an accompanied blog post: <link> FIFA World Cup 2018: A Data-Drive Approach to Ideal Team Line Up.</link>

Here's a visualization of Haberman's Cancer Survival Data Set in Jupyter Notebook.
