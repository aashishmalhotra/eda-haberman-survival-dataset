# Haberman's Cancer Survival Data Set
In this project, I did an Exploratory Data Analysis: in-depth analysis and visualization on the FIFA18 dataset. The dataset is collected at this [Kaggle repository](). The goal is to predict the best possible international squad lineups for these 10 teams: France, Germany, Spain, England, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Portugal, Uruguay, and Croatia at the 2018 World Cup this summer in Russia.

The complete notebook can be accessed [here]().

I also wrote an accompanied blog post. An accompanied Medium blog post has been written and can be viewed here: [A Thorough Investigation of Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset using Explorartory Data Analysis]()
